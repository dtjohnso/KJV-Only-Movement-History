# Historical Analysis

Straub on the challenge of analyzing the history of the movement:

> Because  of  the  populist  nature  of  the KJV-only movement within  fundamentalism,  it  is  not  easy  to  determine when  this  movement  began  to  surface  within  the  large  and  rather  amorphous  movement  of  self-identified fundamentalists. No  single  academic  institution  seems  to  have  initially  championed  this  position. Moreover,  when  examining  fundamentalist  institutions,  among  the  older  institutions  still  adhering  to  their heritage,  there  is  a  mixture  among  the  alumni  with  prominent  defenders  of  the  KJV-only  position  and prominent  rejecters  of  the  position  from  the  various  schools. For  example,  among  the  alumni  of  the institution where I teach [Central Baptist Theological Seminary, MN], there are published proponents on both sides of the debate. Additionally,  the  first fundamentalist  school  I  attended [Bob Jones University, SC] also  had  well-known  and  published  advocates  on  each  side  of  the debate.[^4]

## Forerunners of the KJV-Only Movement
### Benjamin G. Wilkinson (1872–1968)

![](images/wilkinson.jpg)

- Published *Our Authorized Bible Vindicated* (1930)
- Seventh-Day Adventist

---

## Forerunners of the KJV-Only Movement
### Jasper J. Ray

![](images/tn_OnlyOneBible.jpg)

- Published *God  Wrote  Only  One Bible* (1955)
- Straub: "Ray  plagiarized  heavily  from  Wilkinson,  though  he  did  not  acknowledge  his  debt  to  him  in  his book."[^1] <!-- So Straub, did he or didn't he? -->

---

## Forerunners of the KJV-Only Movement
### Edward F. Hills (1912–1981)

![](images/KJVDefended.jpg)

- Th.D. graduate of Harvard
- Dissertation on textual criticism
- Published *The  King  James  Version  Defended* (1956)
- Straub: "The  essence  of  Hills's  argument  was  that  God
has  providentially  preserved  his  word  and  therefore,  the  Scriptures  should  be  treated  in  a  way  quite  unlike
all other ancient texts."[^2]

## Forerunners of the KJV-Only Movement
### Edward F. Hills on providential preservation

> God’s  preservation  of  the  New  Testament  text  was  not  miraculous  but  providential.  The  scribes and  printers  who  produced  the  copies  of  the  New  Testament  Scriptures  and  the  true  believers who  read  and  cherished  them  were  not  inspired  but  God-guided.  Hence  there  are  some  New Testament passages in which the true reading cannot be determined with absolute certainty....
>
> In  other words, God  does  not  reveal  every  truth with  equal  clarity.  In  biblical  textual  criticism,  as in  every  other  department  of  knowledge,  there  are  still  some  details  in  regard  to which we must be  content  to  remain  uncertain,  but  the  special  providence  of  God  has  kept  these  uncertainties down  to  a minimum.  Hence  if  we  believe  in  the  special  providential  preservation  of  the Scriptures  and  make  this  the  leading  principle  of  our  biblical  textual  criticism,  we  obtain maximum  certainty,  all  the  certainty  that  any  mere  man  can  obtain,  all  the  certainty  that  we need.  For  we  are  led  by  the  logic  of  faith  to  the  Masoretic  Hebrew  text,  to  the  New  Testament Textus Receptus, and to the King James Version.[^3]

## The Battle for the King James Version

### David Otis Fuller (1903--1988)

- Early on, Fuller was **not** KJVO, based on correspondence with Edgar J. Goodspeed in 1932:

> Fuller states that he "preferred" the KJV “from  the  standpoint  of  the  beauty  of  the  language.  I realize  that  it  is  not  as  accurate  as  the  Revised  but  the  accuracy  does  not  extend  to  the  doctrine  but  merely to  the  clearness  of  the  thought  expressed.  All  of  the  versions  I  believer *[sic]*   were  verbally  inspired,  in  the original  manuscripts.”[^5]

### David Otis Fuller (1903--1988)

+ Fuller later developed a view of preservation:

> For  the  providence  of  God  was  watching  over  this  sacred  text  even  during  the  first  three centuries  of  the  Christian  era.  Even  during  this  troubled  period  a  sufficient  number  of trustworthy  copies  of  the  New  Testament  Scriptures  were  produced  by  true  believers  under  the guidance  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  These  were  the  manuscripts  to  which  the  whole  Greek  Church returned  during  the  fourth  and  fifth  centuries,  again  under  the  leading  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and from which the Byzantine text was derived.[^6]

## The Battle for the King James Version

### David Otis Fuller (1903--1988)

![](images/tn_WhichBible.jpg)

- Primary contribution to the KJVO position was the publication of *Which Bible?* in 1970
- Straub: "*Which Bible?* was a compilation of articles from a variety of authors, living and dead, some of  which  were  in  print  in  other  places,  that  attempted  to  prove  Fuller’s  views  stated  in  the  introduction. Significant  is  the  fact  that  Fuller  reproduced  much  of  the  earlier  work  of  Wilkinson  that  lay  behind  Ray’s book,  omitting  the  fact  that  Wilkinson  was  a  Seventh-Day  Adventist,  describing  him  merely  as  a  man  'all  but unknown to the world of scholarship' who 'taught for many years at a small and obscure Eastern college.'"[^7]

- Other features of Fuller's argument:
	+ Argues for the superiority of the KJV based on the character of the translators
	+ Attacks higher criticism in general
	+ Attacks the textual criticism of Westcott and Hort
- These features, along with the appeal to Wilkinson and Ray, became "standard fare in pro-KJV literature following Fuller, but usually with much less sophistication."[^8]

## The Battle for the King James Version

### David Otis Fuller (1903--1988)

Evaluation:

- Despite Fuller's influential position, the GARBC never officially adopted a KJV only position
- "Fuller’s  book  appears  more  scholarly  and  sophisticated  than  many  of  the  subsequent  defenses of  the  KJV."
- "Fuller  himself  apparently  had  a  working  knowledge  of  Greek  and  Hebrew,  unlike  many  modern defenders  of  the  KJV."
- "He  also  attempted  to  maintain  a  higher  level  of  Christian  civility  in  his  defense  of  the KJV."[^9]

### Pensacola Christian College controversy (1996--1998)

* Response video *Fundamentalism and the Word of God* (1998) "argued  against  the  KJV  being  a  test  of  orthodoxy  both necessarily  and  historically  and  demonstrated  how  many  well-known  fundamentalist  leaders  of  the  past used modern versions."[^11]

	+ Unsupported assertions
	+ Misinformation
	+ Straub: "There  are  plenty  of  quotes  from  new  age  writers  but  there  is  no apparent connection between their beliefs and the connection that Riplinger says exists."
- Reception
	+ Straub: She has "fallen  out  of  favor  among  many  fundamentalists  due  to  her  unusual associations,  shrill  tone,  and  dubious  background."[^12]

--- 

## Contemporary Combatants

	+ Th.D. in Bible Exposition from Dallas Theological Seminary (1955)

	+ Uses a  better  Greek text  (the TR)
	+ Translators  of  the  KJV  more devout/orthodox  than  modern  translators
	+ Uses a better translation philosophy (formal equivalence)
	+ Has better theology than  modern  versions (Straub: "Waite  argues,  for example  that  the  bibliology  of  the  KJV  is  better  because  it  includes  the  longer  ending  of  Mark."[^13])

--- 

## Contemporary Combatants

### William Grady

* A more recent defender of the KJV
* Pastor of Macedonia  Baptist  Church  of  Swartz  Creek,  Michigan who has self-published two books defending the KJV
* Primary concerns
	- Believes that belief in the KJV is necessary to preserve divine authority
	- Believes that the KJV should be viewed as *superior* to the Textus Receptus
	- Seeks to expose those who hold a so-called "Pseudo King James Only" view
* Reception
	- Many King James Only proponents reject Grady as extreme (*cf.* Crown College chapel message)
	- Grady has labeled those who disagree with him using Ruckman-like rhetoric

# Evaluation

Below are several points of analysis, drawn directly from Straub:

> 1. Belief  in  the  superiority  of  the  KJV  is  a  relatively  new  position  in  fundamentalist circles  and  goes  well  beyond  the  historic  tenets  of  fundamentalism.
> 2.  There  is  no unified  movement.
> 3. Few  men  or  women  in  the  movement  have  the  academic  training to  speak  to  the  issues  involved  with  the  textual  critical  matters.
> 4. There  does  not  appear  to  be  any  realistic  hope  that  the  KJV-only  position  will  die out  any  time  in  the  near  future.
> 5. Those  who  champion  the  KJV  as  the  only  legitimate  translation  of  the English  Bible  fail  to  grasp  the  essential  nature  of  Christianity.
